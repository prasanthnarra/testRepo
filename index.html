        This moment is perfect, to tell you a story, <br> Of two people most ordinary, <br>who will soon come together to start a new era of glory.

		Please bear with us if our lines don’t rhyme, <br> we’re putting together something like this for the first time.<br>So, let’s see... Before we were first told of each other,<br>Our lives were sufficiently busy to not really bother;<br>of what was in store for us.    
	</div>
    
    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 wedding-text-three">
		First week of October 2013 is what we rightly remember,<br> The time that brought along a change to be cherished forever.<br><br>
		When I was first told of Sruthi, my heart felt that “She was the One”;<br>October 13 only confirmed that my season for love had just begun.
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 wedding-text-four">
		It was a bliss, when I heard her say, <br>“I always knew you were the one, and had waited for you many a night and day...”<br><br>
		Until now, these lines meant nothing but typical “Bollywood” brew,<br> But suddenly their intervention seemd realistic too...
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 wedding-text-five">
		And then the story went on, as a new life of love and care was bestowed upon Us,<br>where my ambition became to fulfil all her dreams, & she discovered my love for musical themes.
    </div>
    
    <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 wedding-text-six">
		Slowly, ice creams replaced laddus, & fondness grew for sarees, All we hoped for was, “May it pass sooner! this month of February”...    
	</div>
	
	<div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 wedding-text-seven">
		And now that Feb is almost past and March is rushing, We invite all of you for your love and blessings.<br><br>
		Please do come, and grace the occasion, of our union this beautiful season.
